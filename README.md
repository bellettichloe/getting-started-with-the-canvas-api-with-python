### What to do from here

Write your own code and run it! Be mindful that the API is running on the production Canvas instance - if you want to run against the Beta or Test instance, change the URL in `.env` to `https://ubc.test.instructure.com/api/v1` or `http://ubc.beta.instructure.com/api/v1` and regenerate your token(s) from the Beta/Test site.
